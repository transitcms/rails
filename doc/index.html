<p><img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/transitcms/engine.png?branch=master&amp;.png" alt="Build Status"></p>

<p>Transit is a content delivery engine for Rails using MongoDB. Content delivery engine is not just a fancy word but more clearly defines the purpose 
that the gem aims to solve. Most Rails based CMS solutions are &quot;ready to go&quot; applications, where a few simple configurations will get you up and running with 
a full (often well designed) admin interface and all.</p>

<p>The goal of Transit is to be more developer-oriented, for use in situations where you still want to develop custom content managed applications, but avoid 
having to do a lot of the same routine development thats common to most if not all content management systems.</p>

<p>Transit operates around the concept that all content management can be broken down into two basic types of models (called deliverables): a Post or a Page. </p>

<p>Each <em>deliverable</em>  can embed one or many <code>contexts</code> which are representations of a particular type of content included within that deliverable.</p>

<h2>Posts</h2>

<p>Posts are your standard blog/article/etc posts, which consist of a 
* title
* post date
* published/un-published status
* a <em>body</em> which defines the content that post contains.
* a <em>teaser</em> which is used as a &quot;preview&quot; of the post.
* a slug which represents the url to the post. On creation, this field is automatically created from the title unless already provided.</p>

<h2>Pages</h2>

<p>Pages are the &quot;standalone&quot; version of a post. Whereas posts operate on a feed type system, pages are singular in nature and consist of
* a url (ie: slug).
* a name (whether internal or for use in a heading tag)
* a page title
* optional keywords
* a page description
* one or more <em>body</em> areas depending on the layout of the particular page.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<p>Deliverables associate (ie: embed) one or more <code>contexts</code> which, when combined, represent the content a particular package contains. Each context is assigned 
any number of attributes, and a <code>position</code> which defines the order in which that context exists in the flow of content.</p>

<p>Instead of cramming content into some wysiwyg editor (which is generally good for nothing except butchering a well-designed layout), 
multiple contexts can be created and chained together, limiting html/rich-text editing to basic formatting.</p>

<p>For instance, a basic blog post can be broken down into a primary heading, and some body content. In terms of contexts, this can be broken down into a 
<code>InlineText</code> and <code>TextBlock</code>. When creating your custom Blog cms, you could then specify that each time a new post is created, it should initially contain 
these two contexts, as well as the order (ie: InlineText &gt; TextBlock). When users create new content, they then have these two fields available to them. </p>

<p>The true benefit of contexts is in the output. Given the example above, you now have a way to cleanly output a blog post, with a proper heading (ie: h1) 
and well formatted body copy. Output is left to the discretion of the developer, not the end-user.</p>

<p>Should you want to provide additional functionality, any number of contexts can be added to a deliverable. Your users want to add video or audio to 
their blog posts? No problem. In addition, since each context contains a <code>position</code> property, by simply sorting/and arranging each context, the 
resulting output can be altered to whatever desired result.</p>

<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>

<p>Content is delivered by using the <code>deliver</code> method in your views, passing a particular deliverable containing contexts.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code>&lt;%= deliver(@post) %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>By default the helper will attempt to deliver content in one of 2 ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>If a <code>deliver</code> method exists on a context model, the result of that method will be output</li>
<li><p>Using a pre-defined delivery block that, when passed a context the necessary html to render that context. For example, to deliver an <code>Audio</code>
context using Rails&#39; built in audio tag helper:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code><span class='const'>Transit</span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='const'>Delivery</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_configure'>configure</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='symbol'>:audio</span><span class='rparen'>)</span> <span class='kw'>do</span> <span class='op'>|</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_context'>context</span><span class='op'>|</span>
    <span class='id identifier rubyid_audio_tag'>audio_tag</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_context'>context</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_source'>source</span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
<span class='kw'>end</span>
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<h2>Contexts</h2>

<p>There are 4 basic contexts included in the core engine:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>InlineText</strong>: Text that is best represented by a single html node, such as a heading (h1, h2, h3, etc).</li>
<li><strong>TextBlock</strong>: Used to represent body copy / content. This is usually managed with a wysiwyg editor</li>
<li><strong>Video</strong>: Allows inserting video from multiple sources, whether file upload, youtube url, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Audio</strong>: Same function as video... but included separately to allow for more customization.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Creating Custom Contexts</h3>

<p>To create a custom context, simply create a model that subclasses the Context model. </p>

<h2>Additional Items</h2>

<h3>Content Blocks</h3>

<p>Content blocks are similar to pages, but are simply wrappers for storing/delivering a set of contexts. Content blocks are useful for things like 
sidebars or areas of content that are used in multiple places within the site, providing a single point of access and management in your back-ends.</p>

<h3>Assets</h3>

<p>To provide support for file and image uploads, an Asset model is provided. This model can accept any type of file upload, stored as the <code>file</code> field. 
The asset model also provides methods to determine whether a file is an <code>image?</code>, <code>video?</code>, or <code>audio?</code>. </p>
